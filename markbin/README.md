# MarkBin

A markdown workspace collaborator.

## Challenges

1. Users must be able to navigate to different 'pages'
2. Need a full authentication system
3. The 'bins' collection requires a schema that can figure out who a bin belongs to, who has access to it via sharing, and the actual markdown text
4. Must be able to resolve whether a user has access to a given bin
5. Must be able to generate a list of all the bins a user should have access to (for the list page)
